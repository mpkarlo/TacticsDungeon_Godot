# Tactics: Dungeon

## Summary

A real-time action role-playing game with a top-down perspective. You control the character as usual, but have a resource, called Action Points, that limits movements and abilities. You spend action points as you move, attack, and perform actions in real-time. Action Points regenerate when you stand still. The enemies also play by the same rules and are also governed by the Action Point system.

## Mechanics

### Core Mechanics

- Movement and actions are limited by the Action Point System.
- Action Points regenerate naturally when not performing any action.
- Room or Level based.
- If a character “overdraws” their Action Points, you must take a time penalty before they start regenerating again.

### Extra Mechanics

- Multiple controllable characters
- Different classes
- Interchangeable weapon system
- Procedurally generated levels
